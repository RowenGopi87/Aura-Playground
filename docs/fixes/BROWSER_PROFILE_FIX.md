# Browser Profile Fix: Resolving "Browser is already in use"

## Problem
When a test case is triggered from the Aura web application (running on `localhost:3000`), the following error occurs:

```
Error: Browser is already in use for C:\Users\...\ms-playwright\mcp-chrome-profile
```

This error does not occur when running tests from a simple local HTML file.

## Root Cause
Your analysis was spot on. The issue is not just the existence of a browser profile, but that a **Chrome browser process remains running and locks the profile** after a test is initiated from the `localhost` server environment.

When a test is triggered from a long-running web application like Aura, the browser session launched by Playwright isn't always terminated cleanly. This lingering process holds a lock on the `mcp-chrome-profile` directory, preventing any new test from starting and causing the "Browser is already in use" error.

## Solution: Graceful Browser Shutdown
The correct and most robust solution is to ensure the browser process is **gracefully and reliably terminated after every single test run**, regardless of whether the test passes or fails.

We have implemented this fix directly within the `mcp_server.py` by adding a `finally` block to the test execution endpoint.

### How It Works
The `execute_test_case` function in `mcp_server.py` now includes this critical code:
```python
    finally:
        # **CRITICAL FIX**: Ensure the browser session is always closed
        if agent and agent.client:
            try:
                print("üßπ Closing browser session to release profile lock...")
                await agent.client.close_all_sessions()
                print("‚úÖ Browser session closed successfully.")
            except Exception as close_e:
                print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è Error closing browser session: {close_e}")
```
- The `finally` block **guarantees** that this code runs every time the `execute-test-case` endpoint is called, even if errors occur during the test.
- It explicitly calls `agent.client.close_all_sessions()`, which properly shuts down the Playwright browser, terminates the Chrome process, and releases the lock on the profile directory.

## How to Use
No special action is needed from you. The fix is now part of the server's core logic.

1.  **Stop all existing servers** using `stop-all-servers.bat` or by closing the terminal windows.
2.  **Run the main startup script** as you normally would:
    ```batch
    start-aura-with-mcp.bat
    ```

The server will now automatically clean up after each test, preventing profile conflicts.

## Key Benefits
- **Correct Fix**: Addresses the root cause (lingering browser process) instead of a symptom (the locked profile).
- **Extremely Reliable**: The `finally` block ensures cleanup happens every single time.
- **No Workarounds**: No need for `--isolated` flags or deleting profile directories.
- **Seamless Integration**: The fix is entirely on the server-side, requiring no changes to your workflow.

## Files Modified
- `mcp/mcp_server.py`

## Files Removed
- `clear-browser-profile.bat` (No longer needed)

This server-side solution is much more robust and should permanently resolve the "Browser is already in use" error. Thank you again for your valuable insight that led to this better implementation.
