# Definitive Fix for "Browser is already in use"

## Problem
The error `Error: Browser is already in use` continues to appear, even after previous attempts to fix it.

## Root Cause Analysis
The logs clearly show that the error occurs *before* the server can run its post-test cleanup code. This confirms that a locked browser profile exists from a *previous, incomplete session*.

The core issue is a race condition in a development environment:
1.  A test run starts.
2.  For some reason (e.g., stopping the server mid-test), the browser process doesn't close.
3.  The browser process holds a lock on the `mcp-chrome-profile` directory.
4.  The *next* time you run a test, the Playwright server tries to access the locked profile and immediately fails.

## The Definitive Two-Stage Solution
To solve this permanently, we are implementing a robust, two-stage cleanup strategy that handles both old and new processes.

### Stage 1: The Hammer (At Startup)
We have re-introduced **automatic profile deletion** into the startup scripts (`start-aura-with-mcp.bat` and silent).

**What it does**: Before any servers are launched, the script now forcefully deletes the entire `mcp-chrome-profile` directory.
**Why it works**: This guarantees that you start with a completely clean slate every time. Any lingering locks from past sessions are wiped away, ensuring the new Playwright server can create a fresh, unlocked profile without conflict.

```batch
echo üóëÔ∏è Clearing old browser profile to prevent conflicts...
if exist "%LOCALAPPDATA%\ms-playwright\mcp-chrome-profile" (
    rmdir /s /q "%LOCALAPPDATA%\ms-playwright\mcp-chrome-profile"
    echo ‚úÖ Cleared stale browser profile.
)
```

### Stage 2: The Housekeeper (After Each Test)
We are keeping the **graceful browser shutdown** logic in `mcp_server.py`.

**What it does**: After each test case finishes (pass or fail), the server explicitly closes the browser session it just used.
**Why it works**: This is good practice that prevents the *current* test run from becoming the *next* session's problem. It cleans up after itself to keep the system tidy.

```python
finally:
    if agent and agent.client:
        await agent.client.close_all_sessions()
```

## How to Use
Your workflow does not change.
1.  **Stop all running servers**.
2.  **Use the startup script** as usual: `start-aura-with-mcp.bat`.

The system now automatically handles both pre-emptive cleanup and post-test tidying.

## Key Benefits
- **Resilient**: Solves the problem even if previous sessions crashed or were interrupted.
- **Comprehensive**: Addresses the issue at both startup and shutdown, leaving no room for failure.
- **Reliable**: This hybrid approach is the standard, robust way to manage stateful resources in a development environment.

This definitive solution should finally put the "Browser is already in use" error to rest.
